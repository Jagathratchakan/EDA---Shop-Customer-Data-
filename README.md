# EDA---Shop-Customer-Data-

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process for the Shop Customer data with the given columns can be described as follows:

Data Collection:

The first step is to collect the data from the shop's records or any other reliable source. The data includes the following columns:
CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income ($): The annual income of the customer in dollars.
Spending Score (1-100): A score representing the customer's spending behavior (ranging from 1 to 100, higher score indicates higher spending).
Profession: The profession or occupation of the customer.
Work Experience: The number of years of work experience of the customer.
Family Size: The size of the customer's family.
Data Inspection:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, size, and data types of each column.
Check for any missing values, data inconsistencies, or outliers that might affect the analysis.
Data Cleaning:

Handle any missing values or outliers appropriately. For example, you may choose to impute missing values or remove rows with missing data.
Ensure that data types are correctly assigned for each column.
Summary Statistics:

Calculate summary statistics for numerical columns, such as Age, Annual Income, Spending Score, Work Experience, and Family Size.
Gain insights into the distribution of each numerical feature and identify any trends or patterns.
Data Visualization:

Use various visualization techniques to gain insights into the data and understand relationships between different variables.
Create histograms or density plots to visualize the distribution of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.
Create scatter plots or box plots to explore relationships between numerical variables, such as Annual Income and Spending Score.
Use bar charts or pie charts to visualize categorical variables, such as Gender and Profession.
Visualize the distribution of Family Size and Work Experience.
Gender Spending Pattern:

Group the data by Gender and calculate the average Spending Score for each gender group.
Calculate the average percentage of spending from income for each gender group to understand which gender mostly spends money and how much they spend relative to their income.
Profession Counts by Gender:

Group the data by Gender and Profession to count the number of occurrences of each profession within each gender group.
Create a bar plot to visualize the profession counts based on gender.
Insights and Conclusions:

Analyze the visualizations and summary statistics to draw insights about customer demographics, spending behavior, and profession distribution based on gender.
Summarize the findings and make data-driven conclusions that can be used for business decision-making and future strategies.
Overall, the EDA process allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Shop Customer data, identify patterns, and derive meaningful insights that can help improve business operations and customer experience.
